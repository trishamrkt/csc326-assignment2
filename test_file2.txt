Vernon and Petunia Dursley, with their one-year-old son Dudley, are proud to say that they
are the most normal people possible. They happily occupy 4 Privet Drive, located in the 
Surrey County town of Little Whinging. Vernon is the director of a drill company called
Grunnings, while Petunia does housework and looks after Dudley, yet she always spends so
much time craning over garden fence to spy on the neighbours. Despite all this, the Dursley family are the least
people anyone expects to be involved in anything funny or disturbing, for they don't hold with such nonsense in 
their daily lives. The story begins on a Tuesday 1 November, 1981, where many absurd things happen. When all
three Dursleys are gossiping happily at breakfast trying to wrestle Dudley in his high chair.
